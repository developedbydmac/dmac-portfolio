      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>2018</h3>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>2019-2020</h3>
        <p>Stayed at IBM and grew into QA Automation. Build automation frameworks, implemented monitoring, created reports for leadership, and made sure critical apps stayed reliable Learned about Datadog, Jenkins, and CI/CD hands-on. Became the go-to for catching bugs before they hit prod.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>2021</h3>
        <p>Joined Chick-fil-A as a QA Automation Engineer. Worked on apps for U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico markets. Integrated Cypress and Postman into pipelines, used AWS for test environments, and leveled up my cloud understanding.</p>
      </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>2022</h3>
        <p>Moved to LexisNexis, where I dove into Azure DevOps, Terraform, and containerized testing in AKS. I tackled authentication flows, managed test infrastructure, and sharpened my skills in performance testing and reporting..</p>
      </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>2023-2024</h3>
        <p>Started my DevOps journey by studying Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, and building projects from scratch. Life took a turn when I got laid off, so I returned to my CDL roots to keep things steady â€” delivering beer by day and writing code between routes..</p>
      </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>2025</h3>
        <p>Right now Iâ€™m working as an IT Specialist at Live Nation, handling everything tech on site. Some days Iâ€™m connecting printers or helping staff get online. Other days Iâ€™m climbing on the roof to run cables or patching into a switch backstage before a show starts. Outside of that, Iâ€™m raising my kids, running my own security business, going back to school, and still building my DevOps portfolio. Lifeâ€™s full, but Iâ€™m locked in, making every move count.</p>
